1. Big oh notation (O): 
It is define as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance).
Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound. 

2. Big Omega notation (Ω) : 
It is define as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case).
Just like O notation provide an asymptotic upper bound, Ω notation provides asymptotic lower bound. 

3. Big Theta notation (Θ) : 
It is define as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times that the algorithm can take.
 
Little Omega (ω) is a rough estimate of the order of the growth whereas Big Omega (Ω) may represent exact order of growth
