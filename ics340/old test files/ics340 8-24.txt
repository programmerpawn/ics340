graph theory 


*a city with no roads 
can't have a road with no cities 
coming and going nowhere
node thats leaves and goes
edges and verticels = what a graph is 
relationships of nodes
leaving a node and getting a node 
head of the edge 
and the tail of the node 
think of an arrow 
tail ----> head
how the graph is related no space is required
graph:
list of nodes
list of edges 
node: 
name
who is attached
how the node arrives
how the node goes out



edge:
tail 
head distance


degree how many it's touching
indegree what is touching it
outdegree where it's going

for test filea1
input
row is for the value of the names
ex)
alpha outgoing edges prints b c and e 
(just look at the handout lol)

first see if you can print it first with their indegree and outdegree

instance variables are what describes that object 


==============
AI stuff
an agent is somethings that acts in an environment
agent acts intelligently if:
its action are appropriate for its goals and circumstances 
flecible to changing environments and goals 
learns from experience 
it makes appropriate choices given percceptual and copmutational limitations
"there's limits"
